## Project Structure

```
.
├── App.js                # Main app logic and state wiring
├── components/           # Reusable UI components (DayBlock, TaskRow, AddTaskModal, ThemeToggle)
├── hooks/                # Custom React hooks (useTasks, useCurrentTime)
├── utils.js              # Utility functions (date formatting, etc)
├── theme.js              # Theme objects (light/dark/base)
├── styles.js             # Centralized StyleSheet
├── ...                   # Native and config files
```

## Architecture & Best Practices
- **Highly modular:** UI, logic, and styles are separated for maintainability and scalability.
- **Custom hooks:** All business logic (task management, time) is encapsulated in hooks for reusability and testability.
- **Single-responsibility components:** Each component does one thing and is easy to test and extend.
- **Centralized theming and styles:** Themes and styles are managed in their own files for easy updates and consistency.
- **Persistent local storage:** All data is stored locally using AsyncStorage; no cloud or external API dependencies.
